👩🏻‍🔬 I'm currently a 2nd year Ph.D Student in Materials Science & Engineering
🧪 My research interest is focused on molecular beam epitaxy of materials for long-wave infrared sensors.
✍🏻 I am passionate about mentorship and science communication.

## Highlights

### Sci-Comm

Recently, I have been working with the Materials Research Society through the under-represented and minority (UREM) student writing program to write for the [MRS Meeting Scene](https://materials.typepad.com/mrs_meeting_scene/2024/04/symposium-xmrsthe-kavli-foundation-frontiers-of-materials.html) and [MRS Bulletin](https://doi.org/10.1557/s43577-024-00712-x).
